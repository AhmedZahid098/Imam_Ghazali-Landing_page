            Imam Al-Ghazālī was born in 1058 ce in the small village of Tus,
            near the town of Masshad in Persia (modern-day Iran). His name was
            Abu Hamid Muhammad Ibn Muhammad Al-Ghazali أَبُو حَامِدٍ مُحَمَّدُ
            بْنُ مُحَمَّدٍ ٱلطُّوسِيُّ ٱلْغَزَالِيُّ He may have been named
            after his father's business, as ghazzali means "wool merchant." His
            father was a Sufi. He had several sisters and a brother, Ahmad, who
            became a Sufi poet. Al-Ghazālī's father died when he was very young,
            and he and his brother were left in the care of a Sufi friend, Ahmad
            al-Radkhani, who had promised to educate the boys. Economic
            conditions were not good, but by the age of fifteen, arrangements
            had been made for al-Ghazālī to continue his studies with a leading
            scholar, Abu Nasr al-Ismaʾili, in the region of Jurgan, on the
            Caspian Sea. <br />

            Al-Ghazālī would later note in his autobiography, al-Munkidh min
            al-Dalal (Deliverance from Error), that he was more ambitious than
            religious as a young man. He pursued a scholarly religious path at
            first because that was what was available to a young man with little
            money or family standing. So, while studying with various teachers,
            he took notes, but did not bother to consider or memorize the
            lessons. One story tells how he was returning to his native Tus from
            Jurgan when his group was attacked by bandits. When al-Ghazālī
            begged that they not steal his school notebooks, the leader of the
            robbers laughed at him. The robber said that obviously al-Ghazālī
            was not much of a scholar if all his learning was kept in notebooks
            and not in his mind. From this point on, al-Ghazālī memorized his
            lessons instead of simply copying them down. <br />

            When al-Ghazālī was nineteen he earned a place at a religious
            college, or madrasa, in Nishapur, about 50 miles west of Tus. In
            Nishapur he studied with one of the major religious scholars of the
            generation, Abu al-Malik al-Juwayni (died 1085), also known as Imam
            al-Haramayn. Al-Juwayni was the imam, or religious leader, of the
            two most sacred cities in Islam, Mecca and Medina. Al-Ghazālī
            studied both Islamic law and religion and was introduced to the work
            of two earlier Islamic thinkers, Abu al-Nasr al-Farabi (870–950) and
            Ibn Sina (980–1037). These men attempted to combine the use of
            reason and rational thought developed by ancient Greek philosophers
            with the Islamic belief in one supreme being, Allah. <br />

            Al-Ghazālī was a bright student and became a favorite of al-Juwayni.
            After finishing his studies, he remained for a time at the school
            and helped with teaching. The young Muslim scholar soon came to the
            attention of the powerful vizier (state official), Nizam al-Mulk
            (1018–1092). The minister had built the college in Nishapur, as well
            as several others in Persia and what is modern-day Iraq. After the
            death of al-Juwayni, Nizam al-Mulk invited al-Ghazālī to come to
            Baghdad, in modern-day Iraq, the administrative center of the
            Islamic empire.

            In Baghdad al-Ghazālī served Nizam al-Mulk as a legal advisor,
            taught, wrote, and enjoyed the company of other scholars. In 1091,
            at only thirty-three years old, he was named the chief professor at
            Baghdad's Nizamiyya college. This was one of the most prominent
            positions in the Muslim world. He lectured to large crowds of
            students on law and logic. He was noted for giving clear and easily
            understood presentations on complicated religious matters. He also
            wrote one of his best known works, The Incoherence of the
            Philosophers, in which he attempted to reveal the mistakes in the
            theories of al-Farabi and Ibn Sina. He believed these earlier
            thinkers had relied too much on rational thought, which he felt was
            not adequate for understanding concepts such as Allah and infinity,
            or something without boundaries. <br />

            Al-Ghazālī's philosophy was adopted by a group known as the Kalam
            thinkers, who attempted to prove that the universe had a beginning
            and therefore was created by Allah. The basic Kalam argument takes
            the following form: The universe had a beginning. Everything that
            has a beginning has a cause. Therefore, the universe has a cause,
            which is Allah. In their rejection of Aristotle 's (384–322 bce; see
            entry) theory that the world of matter and motion is eternal, the
            Kalam thinkers and al-Ghazālī had much in common. <br />

            During his time in Baghdad, Al-Ghazālī also wrote Fada¿ih
            al-Batiniyya (The Obscenities of the Esoterics), a critical account
            of, among other things, the Assassins, a radical sect of Muslims
            organized in the late eleventh century. The Assassins often killed
            their enemies by using knives or poison. The name came from their
            practice of preparing themselves for their work by using hashishin,
            or the drug hashish. The word "assassination" later became used to
            describe a planned murder. The Assassins killed a number of
            prominent Muslims during al-Ghazālī's years in Baghdad, including
            his sponsor, Nizam al-Mulk. <br />

            Al-Ghazālī's rise in popularity came to a sudden halt. He suffered a
            crisis of belief, and maybe even a nervous collapse. In 1095 he
            developed a stutter that prevented him from lecturing and that
            ultimately made him mute, or unable to talk. Though he later
            recovered his voice and lost the stutter, al-Ghazālī gave up his
            teaching position and left Baghdad. It is possible he left the city
            in part because he feared being killed, due to his published
            criticism of the Assassins. In his autobiography, al-Ghazālī claims
            he could no longer stand the dishonesty he found in many of his
            fellow scholars. He believed they were more interested in money and
            fame than in real learning. He also decided that true religion could
            only come through a direct experience with Allah, not through
            scholarship. As he wrote in his autobiography: "I apprehended
            clearly that the mystics are men who had real experiences, not men
            of words, and that I had already progressed as far as possible by
            way of intellectual apprehension. What remained for me was not to be
            attained by oral instruction and study, but only by immediate
            experience and by walking in the mystic way."

            Al-Ghazali composed three works on Aristotelian logic, Mi‘yar
            al-‘ilm (The Standard Measure of Knowledge), Mihakk al-nazar
            f’l-mantiq (The Touchstone of Proof in Logic) and al-Qistas
            al-mustaqim (The Just Balance). The first two were written
            immediately after the Tahafut `in order to help understanding of the
            latter’, and the third was composed after his retirement. He also
            gave a detailed account of logic in the long introduction of his
            writing on legal theory, al-Mustasfa min ‘ilm al-usul (The
            Essentials of Islamic Legal Theory). Al-Ghazali’s great interest in
            logic is unusual, particularly when most Muslim theologians were
            antagonistic to it, and can be attributed not only to the usefulness
            of logic in refuting heretical views (al-Qistas is also a work of
            refutation of the Isma‘ilis), but also to his being fascinated by
            the exactness of logic and its effectiveness for reconstructing the
            religious sciences on a solid basis. <br />

            There is a fundamental disparity between al-Ghazali’s theological
            view and the Neoplatonic Aristotelian philosophy of emanationism.
            Al-Ghazali epitomizes this view in twenty points, three of which are
            especially prominent: <br />
            (1) the philosophers’ belief in the eternity of the world, <br />
            (2) their doctrine that God does not know particulars, <br />
            (3) their denial of the resurrection of bodies. <br />
            These theses are ultimately reducible to differing conceptions of
            God and ontology. Interestingly, al-Ghazali’s criticism of
            philosophy is philosophical rather than theological, and is
            undertaken from the viewpoint of reason. <br />

            First, as for the eternity of the world, the philosophers claim that
            the emanation of the First Intellect and other beings is the result
            of the necessary causality of God’s essence, and therefore the world
            as a whole is concomitant and coeternal with his existence. Suppose,
            say the philosophers, that God created the world at a certain moment
            in time; that would presuppose a change in God, which is impossible.
            Further, since each moment of time is perfectly similar, it is
            impossible, even for God, to choose a particular moment in time for
            creation. Al-Ghazali retorts that God’s creation of the world was
            decided in the eternal past, and therefore it does not mean any
            change in God; indeed, time itself is God’s creation (this is also
            an argument based on the Aristotelian concept of time as a function
            of change). Even though the current of time is similar in every
            part, it is the nature of God’s will to choose a particular out of
            similar ones. <br />

            Second, the philosophers deny God’s knowledge of particulars or
            confine it to his self-knowledge, since they suppose that to connect
            God’s knowledge with particulars means a change and plurality in
            God’s essence. Al-Ghazali denies this. If God has complete knowledge
            of a person from birth to death, there will be no change in God’s
            eternal knowledge, even though the person’s life changes from moment
            to moment. <br />

            Third, the philosophers deny bodily resurrection, asserting that
            ‘the resurrection’ means in reality the separation of the soul from
            the body after death. Al-Ghazali criticizes this argument, and also
            attacks the theory of causality presupposed in the philosophers’
            arguments. The so-called necessity of causality is, says al-Ghazali,
            simply based on the mere fact that an event A has so far occurred
            concomitantly with an event B. There is no guarantee of the
            continuation of that relationship in the future, since the
            connection of A and B lacks logical necessity. In fact, according to
            Ash‘arite atomistic occasionalism, the direct cause of both A and B
            is God; God simply creates A when he creates B. Thus theoretically
            he can change his custom (sunna, ‘ada) at any moment, and resurrect
            the dead: in fact, this is ‘a second creation’. <br />

            Al-Ghazali thus claims that the philosophers’ arguments cannot
            survive philosophical criticism, and Aristotelian logic served as a
            powerful weapon for this purpose. However, if the conclusions of
            philosophy cannot be proved by reason, is not the same true of
            theological principles or the teachings of revelation? How then can
            the truth of the latter be demonstrated? Herein lies the force of
            al-Ghazali’s critique of reason. <br />

              The Book of Knowledge is the foundation of the forty books of the
              Revival of the Religious Sciences, Imam al-Ghazali’s magnum opus.
              In the Book of Knowledge, he defines knowledge, its relation to
              faith, theology, and jurisprudence. The book deals with the virtue
              of knowledge from both rational and traditional points of view. It
              elucidates the types of knowledge and the nature of people’s
              obligation to seek knowledge. Imam al-Ghazali defines
              jurisprudence and theology as branches of Islamic knowledge, then
              outlines those fields that people incorrectly consider to be
              Islamic disciplines, and distinguishes the praiseworthy from the
              blameworthy. He describes in detail the perils of disputation and
              the reasons people engage in debate and dialectics. He also
              considers the conduct incumbent on the teacher and student, and
              warns of the perils that can befall those pursuing knowledge.
              Finally, Imam al-Ghazali discusses the virtues and categories of
              the intellect and the prophetic traditions related to it.

              The work emphasized the importance of observing the ritual
              requirements of Islam, the actions that would lead to salvation,
              and avoidance of sin. The factor that set the Alchemy apart from
              other theological works at the time was its mystical emphasis on
              self-discipline and asceticism. Sa'āda (happiness) is a central
              concept in Islamic philosophy used to describe the highest aim of
              human striving. Sa'āda is equated with "ultimate happiness",
              namely that of the hereafter. It is achieved only after a human
              being has liberated his/her soul completely from its corporal
              existence, achieving "active intellect". The teachings were to
              help man to live a life in accordance with the sacred law, and by
              doing so gain a deeper understanding of its meaning on the day of
              Judgement.

              Al-Ghazali’s relationship with philosophy is subtle and
              complicated. The philosophy represented by AL-FARABI and IBN SINA
              (Avicenna) is, for al-Ghazali, not simply an object of criticism
              but also an important component of his own learning. Imam Ghazali
              studied philosophy intensively while in Baghdad, composing Maqasid
              al falasifa (The Intentions of the Philosophers), and then
              criticizing it in his Tahafut al falasifa (Incoherence of
              Philosophers). This book was considered a turning point in Islamic
              history, it is generally thought that from this point onwards
              philosophy in the Islamic world went on the decline after
              receiving such a crushing blow from religion in the form of
              al-Ghazali's writings. This translation is well written and
              presented in English that is fairly easy to understand

              The Revival of the Religious Sciences by Imam al-Ghazālī can be
              described as a book that will never die. This is because it
              contains a vital cognitive force that time cannot obliterate. In
              it the Imam discusses Islamic rulings, beliefs and character, in
              the style of an admonisher who understands the psyche and its
              secrets as well as spiritual diseases. What distinguishes this
              book from others is its strong spiritual influence on the reader
              which makes him seek both soundness of heart and his Lord's
              pleasure through acts of worship, rather than the mere performance
              of acts of worship so that they are legally valid. The book is a
              comprehensive encyclopaedia for all of a Muslim's religious
              affairs, including beliefs, acts of worship, dealings and
              character, as well as for individual and societal welfare.
              Al-Ghazālī's style is that of one who practices what he knows, one
              who is determined to rise from the dry, ordinary manner of
              teaching to one which encourages action. Abū Hāmid al-Ghazālī is a
              towering figure in Islam. His enormous influence can be
              summarized, in the words of Annemarie Schimmel, as the one who
              "teaches... only to help man to live a life in accordance with the
              sacred law, not by clinging exclusively to its letter, but by an
              understanding of its deeper meaning ... so that he is ready for
              the meeting with his Lord at any moment." His greatest work Ihyā'
              'Ūlūm al-Dīn (The Revival of the Religious Sciences), comprising
              forty books divided into four quarters of ten books each, has
              helped generations towards this end until today.
